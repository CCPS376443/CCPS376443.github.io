    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have always loved helping people since I was a child.  I enjoy helping someone in need and I know I want to do something that helps others with whatever they need. Some of the experiences that led me here include my interest in helping  homeless people, and seeing them smile makes my day. I also offer my help whenever possible. 
I try my best and contribute whenever I can whether it's at school or at home or anywhere else. I put in effort in anything I do. I volunteer and joined a club where we help students. 
Values I consider most necessary for my success are Leadership, kindness which I believe is a big one for me. Energy is also very necessary for my success, you must be energized. Hardworking and organization. 
Short terms goals I hope to accomplish in the near future are to getting good grades on my tests or at least a passing score. One of my hobbies are reading and so I hope to find a new hobby that I will enjoy as much as I did reading. 
Character traits that I want to be most known for are being compassionate, capable, trustworthy, and generous. Some achievements I want to be known for are having outstanding grades and getting high scores on tests. </p>
